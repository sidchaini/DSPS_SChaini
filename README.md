This class - PHYS 661, is about application of Data Science to concepts in the natural sciences.

- I'm taking this class b/c I use data science in my astronomy research.
- I want to learn about Astrostatistics, VAEs and Transformers.
- I feel I'm good at programming which will be helpful for this course.
